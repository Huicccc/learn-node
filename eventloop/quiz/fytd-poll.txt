- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Call someAsyncOperation().
Inside someAsyncOperation():
  Initiate an asynchronous read operation with fs.readFile().
Call foo().
Print 'foo'.
Print 'done'.
Eventually, the asynchronous read operation completes, and its callback function is executed:
  If there's an error, print 'Read Error'.
  Otherwise, print the data read from the file.
